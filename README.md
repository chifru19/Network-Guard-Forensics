# Network Guard: Forensic & Security Audit Tool

A Python-based network analysis tool that processes PCAP files to visualize traffic patterns, calculate network latency, and audit for unencrypted credential leaks.

## 📊 Project Statistics
* **Total Packets Analyzed:** 15,467
* **Average Latency:** 32.95 ms
* **Security Alerts:** 3 potential cleartext leaks identified.

## 🛠️ Features
* **Automated Forensic Analysis:** Uses the Scapy library to parse raw packet data.
* **Credential Sniffer:** Scans unencrypted payloads for keywords like `pwd`, `auth`, and `user`.
* **Traffic Visualization:** Generates distribution reports for IP sources and protocols.
